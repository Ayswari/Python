<h1>Data Analysis using Python</h1>
<h3>Technology Overview</h3>
<b>1. Platform : Anaconda </b>
<p>Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, 
large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.</p>
<b>2. Environment: Jupyter Notebook</b>
<p>JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. 
Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, 
computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.</p>
<b>3. Library:</b> 
<li>Pandas: Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. 
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" </li>
<li>Numpy: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.</li>
